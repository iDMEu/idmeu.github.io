<title>Ahriche, Amine: The scale invariant scotogenic model: CDF-II $W$-boson mass and the 95~GeV excesses</title>
<link>https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv231108297A</link>
<description>The anomalies observed in the $W$ mass measurements at the CDF-II
experiments and the excesses seen around 95~GeV at the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC) motivate this work, in which we investigate and constrain
the parameter space of the Scale Invariant Scotogenic Model with a
Majorana dark matter candidate. The scanned parameters are chosen to be
consistent with the dark matter relic density and the observed excesses
at $\sim95$~GeV signal strength rates in $\gamma\gamma$, $b\bar b$ and
$\tau^+\tau^-$ final states. Furthermore, the model's viable parameters
can be probed in both the LHC and future $e^+e^-$ colliders for di-Higgs
production.</description>

<title>Alves, J. R.: Updated Big Bang Nucleosynthesis Bounds on Long-lived Particles from Dark Sectors</title>
<link>https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv231107688A</link>
<description>As electromagnetic showers may alter the abundance of Helium, Lithium,
and Deuterium, we can place severe constraints on the lifetime and
amount of electromagnetic energy injected by long-lived particles.
Considering up-to-date measurements of the light element abundances that
point to $Y_p=0.245\pm 0.003$,$({\rm D/H})= (2.527\pm 0.03)\times
10^{-5}$,$(^7{\rm Li/H})=1.58 ^{+0.35}_{-0.28} \times 10^{-10}$,
$(^6{\rm Li/^7 Li})=0.05$, and the baryon-to-photon ratio obtained from
the Cosmic Microwave Background data, $\eta=6.104 \times 10^{-10}$, we
derive upper limits on the fraction of electromagnetic energy produced
by long-lived particles. Our findings apply to decaying dark matter
models, long-lived gravitinos, and other non-thermal processes that
occurred in the early universe between $10^2-10^{10}$ seconds.</description>

<title>Anguelova, Lilia: Dynamics of Inspiraling Dark Energy</title>
<link>https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv231107839A</link>
<description>We investigate the dynamics of a rapid-turning dark energy model, which
arises from certain inspiraling field-space trajectories. We find the
speed of sound $c_s$ of the dark energy perturbations around the
background and show that $c_s$ is monotonically decreasing with time.
Furthermore, it has a positive-definite lower bound that implies a
certain clustering scale. We also extend the previously known background
solution for dark energy to an exact solution that includes matter. This
allows us to address the implications of our model for two cosmological
tensions. More precisely, we argue that the $\sigma_8$ tension can be
alleviated generically, while reducing the Hubble tension requires
certain constraints on the parameter space of the model. Notably, a
necessary condition for alleviating the Hubble tension is that the
transition from matter domination to the dark energy epoch begins
earlier than in $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

<title>Bartram, C.: Non-Virialized Axion Search Sensitive to Doppler Effects in the Milky Way Halo</title>
<link>https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv231107748B</link>
<description>The Axion Dark Matter eXperiment (ADMX) has previously excluded Dine-
Fischler-Srednicki-Zhitnisky (DFSZ) axions between 680-790 MHz under the
assumption that the dark matter is described by the isothermal halo
model. However, the precise nature of the velocity distribution of dark
matter is still unknown, and alternative models have been proposed. We
report the results of a non-virialized axion search over the mass range
2.81-3.31 {\mu}eV, corresponding to the frequency range 680-800 MHz.
This analysis marks the most sensitive search for non-virialized axions
sensitive to Doppler effects in the Milky Way Halo to date. Accounting
for frequency shifts due to the detector's motion through the Galaxy, we
exclude cold flow relic axions with a velocity dispersion of order 10^-7
c with 95% confidence.</description>

<title>Berezhiani, Lasha: Dynamical friction in dark matter superfluids: The evolution of black hole binaries</title>
<link>https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv231107672B</link>
<description>The theory of superfluid dark matter is characterized by self-
interacting sub-eV particles that thermalize and condense to form a
superfluid core in galaxies. Massive black holes at the center of
galaxies, however, modify the dark matter distribution and result in a
density enhancement in their vicinity known as dark matter spikes. The
presence of these spikes affects the evolution of binary systems by
modifying their gravitational wave emission and inducing dynamical
friction effects on the orbiting bodies. In this work, we assess the
role of dynamical friction for bodies moving through a superfluid core
enhanced by a central massive black hole. As a first step, we compute
the dynamical friction force experienced by bodies moving in a circular
orbit. Then, we estimate the gravitational wave dephasing of the binary,
showing that the effect of the superfluid drag force is beyond the reach
of space-based experiments like LISA, contrarily to collisionless dark
matter, therefore providing an opportunity to distinguish these dark
matter models.</description>

<title>Bogorad, Zachary: Coherent Self-Interactions of Dark Matter in the Bullet Cluster</title>
<link>https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv231107648B</link>
<description>Many models of dark matter include self-interactions beyond gravity. A
variety of astrophysical observations have previously been used to place
limits on the strength of such self-interactions. However, previous
works have generally focused either on short-range interactions
resulting in individual dark matter particles scattering from one
another, or on effectively infinite-range interactions which sum over
entire dark matter halos. In this work, we focus on the intermediate
regime: forces with range much larger than dark matter particles' inter-
particle spacing, but still shorter than the length scales of known
halos. We show that gradients in the dark matter density of such halos
would still lead to observable effects. We focus primarily on effects in
the Bullet Cluster, where finite-range forces would lead either to a
modification of the collision velocity of the cluster or to a separation
of the dark matter and the galaxies of each cluster after the collision.
We also consider constraints from the binding of ultrafaint dwarf galaxy
halos, and from gravitational lensing of the Abell 370 cluster. Taken
together, these observations allow us to set the strongest constraints
on dark matter self-interactions over at least five orders of magnitude
in range, surpassing existing limits by many orders of magnitude
throughout.</description>

<title>Chiba, Rimpei: Origin of reduced dynamical friction by dark matter halos with net prograde rotation</title>
<link>https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv231107640C</link>
<description>We provide an explanation for the reduced dynamical friction on galactic
bars in spinning dark matter halos. Earlier work based on linear theory
predicted an increase in dynamical friction when dark halos have a net
forward rotation, because prograde orbits couple to bars more strongly
than retrograde orbits. Subsequent numerical studies, however, found the
opposite trend: dynamical friction weakens with increasing spin of the
halo. We revisit this problem and demonstrate that linear theory in fact
correctly predicts a reduced torque in forward-rotating halos. We show
that shifting the halo mass from retrograde to prograde phase space
generates a positive gradient in the distribution function near the
origin of the z-angular momentum (Lz=0), which results in a resonant
transfer of Lz to the bar, making the net dynamical friction weaker.
While this effect is subdominant for the major resonances, including the
corotation resonance, it leads to a significant positive torque on the
bar for the series of direct radial resonances, as these resonances are
strongest at Lz=0. The overall dynamical friction from spinning halos is
shown to decrease with the halo's spin, in agreement with the secular
behavior of N-body simulations. We validate our linear calculation by
computing the nonlinear torque from individual resonances using the
angle-averaged Hamiltonian.</description>

<title>Cronin, John: Rotating dark matter admixed neutron stars</title>
<link>https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv231107714C</link>
<description>We study rotating compact stars that are mixtures of the ordinary
nuclear matter in a neutron star and fermionic dark matter. After
deriving equations describing a slowly rotating system made up of an
arbitrary number of perfect fluids, we specialize to the two-fluid case,
where the first fluid describes ordinary matter and the second fluid
describes dark matter. Electromagnetic observations of the moment of
inertia and angular momentum directly probe ordinary matter and not dark
matter. Upon taking this into account, we show that the I-Love-Q
relations for dark matter admixed neutrons stars can deviate
significantly from the standard single-fluid relationships.</description>

<title>Das, Anirban: Detecting Dark Matter Induced Power in Quantum Devices</title>
<link>https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv231107857D</link>
<description>In the past few years, many mesoscale systems have been proposed as
possible detectors of sub-GeV dark matter particles. In this work, we
point out the feasibility of probing dark matter-nucleon scattering
cross section using superconductor-based quantum devices with meV-scale
energy threshold. We compute new limits on spin-independent dark matter
scattering cross section using the existing power measurement data from
three different experiments for MeV to 10 GeV mass. We derive the limits
for both halo and thermalized dark matter populations.</description>

<title>Graham, Peter W.: Constraints on Dark Matter from Dynamical Heating of Stars in Ultrafaint Dwarfs. Part 1: MACHOs and Primordial Black Holes</title>
<link>https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv231107654G</link>
<description>We place limits on dark matter made up of compact objects significantly
heavier than a solar mass, such as MACHOs or primordial black holes
(PBHs). In galaxies, the gas of such objects is generally hotter than
the gas of stars and will thus heat the gas of stars even through purely
gravitational interactions. Ultrafaint dwarf galaxies (UFDs) maximize
this effect. Observations of the half-light radius in UFDs thus place
limits on MACHO dark matter. We build upon previous constraints with an
improved heating rate calculation including both direct and tidal
heating, and consideration of the heavier mass range above $10^4 \,
M_\odot$. Additionally we find that MACHOs may lose energy and migrate
in to the center of the UFD, increasing the heat transfer to the stars.
UFDs can constrain MACHO dark matter with masses between about $10
M_\odot$ and $10^8 M_\odot$ and these are the strongest constraints over
most of this range.</description>

<title>Niu, Xuce: Gauged Global Strings</title>
<link>https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv231107639N</link>
<description>We investigate the string solutions and cosmological implications of the
gauge ${\rm U(1)_Z}\,\times$ global ${\rm U(1)_{PQ}}$ model. With two
hierarchical symmetry-breaking scales, the model exhibits three distinct
string solutions: a conventional global string, a global string with a
heavy core, and a gauge string as a bound state of the two global
strings. This model reveals rich phenomenological implications in
cosmology. During the evolution of the universe, these three types of
strings can form a Y-junction configuration. Intriguingly, when
incorporating this model with the QCD axion framework, the heavy-core
global strings emit more axion particles compared to conventional axion
cosmic strings due to their higher tension. This radiation significantly
enhances the QCD axion dark matter abundance, thereby opening up the QCD
axion mass window. Consequently, axions with masses exceeding $\sim
10^{-5}\, {\rm eV}$ have the potential to constitute the whole dark
matter abundance. Furthermore, in contrast to conventional gauge
strings, the gauge strings in this model exhibit a distinctive behavior
by radiating axions.</description>

<title>Santoro, V.: The HIBEAM program: search for neutron oscillations at the ESS</title>
<link>https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv231108326S</link>
<description>With the construction of the European Spallation Source, a remarkable
opportunity has emerged to conduct high sensitivity searches for neutron
oscillations, including a first search for thirty years for free
neutrons converting to antineutrons. Furthermore, searches can be made
for transitions of neutrons and antineutrons to sterile neutron states.
The HIBEAM program provides an increase in sensitivity of an order of
magnitude compared to previous work. The HIBEAM program corresponds to
baryon number violation by one and two units. The observation of a
process satisfying a Sakharov condition addresses the open question of
the origin of the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe. Sterile
neutron states would belong to a `dark' sector of particles which may
explain dark matter. As electrically neutral, meta-stable objects that
can be copiously produced and studied, neutrons represent an attractive
portal to a `dark' sector. This paper describes the capability, design,
infrastructure, and potential of the HIBEAM program. This includes a
dedicated beamline, neutron optical system, magnetic shielding and
control, and detectors for neutrons and antineutrons.</description>

<title>Sheng, Ming-Jie: Spin Speed and Supportedness Correlation and Evolution of Galaxy-Halo Systems</title>
<link>https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv231107969S</link>
<description>Galaxy angular momenta (spins) contain valuable cosmological
information, complementing with their positions and velocities. The
baryonic spin direction of galaxies have been probed as a reliable
tracer of their host halos and the primordial spin modes. Here we use
the TNG100 simulation of the IllustrisTNG project to study the spin
magnitude correlations between dark matter, gas and stellar components
of galaxy-halo systems, and their evolutions across the cosmic history.
We find that these components generate similar initial spin magnitudes
from the same tidal torque in Lagrangian space. At low redshifts, the
gas component still traces the spin magnitude of dark matter halo and
the primordial spin magnitude. However, the traceability of stellar
component depends on the $ex$ $situ$ stellar mass fraction, $f_{\rm
acc}$. Our results suggest that the galaxy baryonic spin magnitude can
also serve as a tracer of their host halo and the initial perturbations,
and the similarity of their evolution histories affects the galaxy-halo
correlations.</description>

<title>Song, Yunjia: Elucidating the impact of massive neutrinos on halo assembly bias</title>
<link>https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv231107650S</link>
<description>Massive neutrinos have non-negligible impact on the formation of large-
scale structures. We investigate the impact of massive neutrinos on the
halo assembly bias effect, measured by the relative halo bias $\hat{b}$
as a function of the curvature of the initial density peak $\hat{s}$,
neutrino excess $\epsilon_\nu$, or halo concentration $\hat{c}$, using a
large suite of $\Sigma M_\nu{=}0.0$ eV and $0.4$ eV simulations with the
same initial conditions. By tracing dark matter haloes back to their
initial density peaks, we construct a catalogue of halo ``twins'' that
collapsed from the same peaks but evolved separately with and without
massive neutrinos, thereby isolating any effect of neutrinos on halo
formation. We detect a $2\%$ weakening of the halo assembly bias as
measured by $\hat{b}(\epsilon_\nu)$ in the presence of massive
neutrinos. Due to the significant correlation between $\hat{s}$ and
$\epsilon_\nu$~($r_{cc}{=}0.319$), the impact of neutrinos persists in
the halo assembly bias measured by $\hat{b}(\hat{s})$ but reduced by an
order of magnitude to $0.1\%$. As the correlation between $\hat{c}$ and
$\epsilon_\nu$ drops to $r_{cc}{=}0.087$, we do not detect any neutrino-
induced impact on $\hat{b}(\hat{c})$, consistent with earlier studies.
We also discover an equivalent assembly bias effect for the ``neutrino
haloes'', whose concentrations are anti-correlated with the large-scale
clustering of neutrinos.</description>

<title>Vaartjes, Arjen: Strong Microwave Squeezing Above 1 Tesla and 1 Kelvin</title>
<link>https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv231107968V</link>
<description>Squeezed states of light have been used extensively to increase the
precision of measurements, from the detection of gravitational waves to
the search for dark matter. In the optical domain, high levels of vacuum
noise squeezing are possible due to the availability of low loss optical
components and high-performance squeezers. At microwave frequencies,
however, limitations of the squeezing devices and the high insertion
loss of microwave components makes squeezing vacuum noise an
exceptionally difficult task. Here we demonstrate a new record for the
direct measurement of microwave squeezing. We use an ultra low loss
setup and weakly-nonlinear kinetic inductance parametric amplifiers to
squeeze microwave noise 7.8(2) dB below the vacuum level. The amplifiers
exhibit a resilience to magnetic fields and permit the demonstration of
record squeezing levels inside fields of up to 2 T. Finally, we exploit
the high critical temperature of our amplifiers to squeeze a warm
thermal environment, achieving vacuum level noise at a temperature of
1.8 K. These results enable experiments that combine squeezing with
magnetic fields and permit quantum-limited microwave measurements at
elevated temperatures, significantly reducing the complexity and cost of
the cryogenic systems required for such experiments.</description>
